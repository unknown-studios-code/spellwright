## Story Quality Checks

Before presenting the Story, verify:

- [ ] User story follows "As a... I want... So that..." format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are behavioral, testable, and focus on outcomes
- [ ] Components section lists data structures with clear purposes (WHAT, not HOW)
- [ ] Systems section lists behaviors with clear responsibilities (WHAT, not HOW)
- [ ] Data flow diagram shows conceptual transformations (not function calls)
- [ ] Architectural decisions include rationale (WHY, not just WHAT)
- [ ] Integration points identify dependencies on other stories
- [ ] Risks are categorized with emoji (🔴🟡🟠🔵) and include mitigation
- [ ] References include design files, documentation, and external resources
- [ ] NO implementation details (no code snippets, no file paths, no line numbers)
- [ ] Uses correct Unity/DOTS terminology (Entity, Component, System, Archetype)
- [ ] All emoticons and markdown formatting preserved
